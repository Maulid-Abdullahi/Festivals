<h2>What about Venetian masks?</h2>
<div class="container1">The tradition of masking has a long tradition in Venice. All the way back in 1268, a law even was passed to ban—of all things—putting on masks and throwing perfumed eggs!

By the time of the Renaissance, masks were a fixture of Carnevale celebrations. By the 16th century, the popular Commedia d’Arte troupe performed slapstick comedy in the piazzas of Venice—while masked. Believe it or not, though, masking was hardly just a Carnival tradition.

By the 18th century, Venetians were allowed to wear masks for six months a year. And they took advantage! Black velvet masks, for example, would be worn in “houses of ill repute”—especially gambling parlors—to shield their owners’ identities, as shown in the painting here...</div>

<h2>So… you’re saying Carnevale in Venice has been celebrated non-stop since the 13th century?</h2>
<div class="container1">If there is one fun festival you have to see in your lifetime, Carnevale di Venezia (Carnival of Venice) should be the one. It is the only carnival in the world that is celebrated to allow people masquerade themselves into their secret fantasies and illusions.For those of you who don’t know what to expect from it, be ready for the unexpected. Hopefully you will be enchanted by a foggy day, where people with long cloaks and masks mysteriously appear and disappear on the ancient Venetian alleys (calli), or maybe.If you’ve ever been to a Mardi Gras celebration you can almost imagine how wonderful the Venice Carnival is. The Venice Carnival is held every year in Venice to celebrate what the city was during the 18th century. Visiting this carnival is a very unique.Not quite. By the 18th century, Venice’s Carnevale festivities were going downhill. With the Austrian conquest of Venice in 1798, mask-wearing—as well as Carnevale—were all but finished. In the 1930s, Mussolini banned the celebrations altogether.So what changed? In 1979, a group of Venetian artisans banned together to restart Carnevale. If that seems like a ploy for tourism, it was—and it was one that worked. Today, about 3 million people travel to Venice every year for Carnevale. The 1970s are also when the long-forgotten art of mask-making was restarted.

<h2>Well, bummer. I’m not going to be in Venice during Carnevale. Can I get in on the fun anyway?</h2>

<div class="container1">Of course—at least when it comes to those Venetian masks! Just be aware that the majority of mask shops in Venice sell cheap, imported masks, a far cry from the artisanal tradition that Venetian mask-making truly is. So do yourself, and the artisans of Venice, a favor, and choose your mask shop carefully. Need help? Here are some of our favorite mask shops in Venice (several of which even run mask-making workshops; check their websites for more!):Benor Maschere Venezia (Santa Croce): Hidden behind Campo San Giacomo dell’Orio, this artisanal mask shop boasts a gorgeous collection, all made there in the workshop. Tel.: +39 041710033. Address: S. Croce 1109.

Ca’ Macana (Dorsoduro): This Venetian mask shop, located just off Camp San Barnaba, has an unparalleled selection of Carnevale masks; better yet, they’re handcrafted in the workshop right there, and you can watch them being made. Tel.: +39 0412776142. Address: Dorsoduro 3172. Ca’ del Sol Maschere (San Marco): Artisans handcraft the Venetian masks at this shop a 5-minute walk from St. Mark’s Basilica; exquisite Carnevale costumes are on sale here, too. Tel.: +39 0415285549. Address: Castello 4964.
Il Canovaccio (Castello): The artisans here create Venetian masks and papier-mâché objects meant for the stage. Tel.: +39 0415210393. Address: Castello 5369.

Happy Carnevale!

<div class="maincontainer">
<h2>The hidden meanings of Venetian street names</h2>
<div class="container1">In lots of Italian towns, street names begin simply with “Via,” like Rome’s famous Via Veneto. In Venice, it’s a little more complicated. Why? Partly because Venice used to have even more canals than it does today. After the train station was built in the 19th century and visitors started coming without their own boats, the city decided to fill in canals and pave them as streets to create more access. And today? You can “read” that history through the hodgepodge of words Venetians use to refer to their streets.

First, in Venice, the word “calle” is used instead of “via”. Pronounced with the “l” (not as it would be in Spanish, making the “ll” a “y”), a calle is a street that runs between two sets of buildings.But many streets aren’t called a calle. Another one to look out for: “salizada.” Salizada means “paved,” and these streets are those that used to be the most important in Venice — so, when Venice’s few streets were paved in brick, these streets were the first to be paved with the more expensive, gray paving stones that you now see almost everywhere.

Then there is ramo. If you see a sign saying “Ramo —-,” then beware: a ramo was built as a blind alleyway, solely to allow access to homes whose main entrance used to be a canal.

So you’ve got calle, salizada, and ramo. On top of it, there’s ruga. “Ruga,” which literally means “wrinkle,” refers to those streets that were some of the longest in Venice. Ruga Rialto might be the best-known.

<h2>The most famous Venetian symbol of all: the winged lion</h2>
<div class="container1">Another symbol that you simply can’t get away from in Venice is the winged lion. On palaces, statues, and the city’s flags, that lion is just everywhere. But here’s the big question: Why a lion for the maritime republic, and not a fish or seagull?

The reason goes back to the ninth century, when Venetian merchants stole the body of St. Mark the apostle from his tomb in Alexandria, Egypt. When a storm almost drowned the graverobbers and their precious cargo, it’s said that St. Mark himself appeared to the captain and told him to lower the sails. The ship was saved, and the merchants said they owed their safety to the miracle.Once they got to Venice and told the story, it didn’t take long for the city to vote him their patron saint. (It helped that another tradition held that St. Mark had himself once stopped on the Venetian coast to avoid a storm — and that an angel then appeared to him, saying the locals would one day venerate him).

What’s usually used to represent St. Mark in Christian iconography? A winged lion.

So keep your eyes open while you’re in Venice. Even the smallest details of what you see have a story to tell.

And stay tuned for a future post on how to decode Venice’s beautiful palaces — each of which have a lot to say about not only Venetian architecture, but also about its history, its residents, and its values!
