<p>The Carnival of Venice is one of the biggest festivals in Europe that originated sometime in the year 1162 AD. This Festival is held in Venice every year between January and February and ends 40 days before Easter with celebration of Lent. This festival was made official during the renaissance period, however was banned by the King of Austria and masks were forbidden. After Napoleon invaded Italy in 1797, the carnival completely stopped for almost two centuries and was recently revived to boost tourism.

In Italy, the festivities usually begin from the weekend before the actual carnival date which is Shrove Tuesday. The official opening of the carnival happens at St. Mark’s Square and it is quite a sight, after which a serious of events like the costume contests, musical performances, theatrical performances and balls continue for a week. At the Carnival, socialites disguise themselves in elaborate masks and costumes, usually from the 18th century and rejoice to their heart’s content. Back then the masks allowed citizens to adopt their alter egos without any fear of the social consequence or judgments based on their roles in the society.

The Carnival of Venice is also known as Mardi Gras and is now celebrated world-over. During the carnival, exquisite Venetian palaces are a host to several Elite Parties that come with a high price tag. Delicious traditional sweets - Frittelle & Galani, can be purchased from any bakery in town, but only during the carnival. .</p>

<p>What once started out in 1945 as a brawl to get some attention (as per poplar story) at the Los G Igantes Carnival in Bunol has now become one of the most famous festivals in Europe.  After a series on bans and un-bans, the wacky tradition was finally embraced by Spanish authorities in 1957, but only after setting a few rules.  At this madcap tomato-throwing event that takes place on the last Wednesday of August each year, participants launch tomato attacks on fellow participants which eventually turns into a full-fledged Food (in this case tomato) war. The chaotic tomato fight takes place between 11 am 1 pm on that day. By the time the event ends, the participants are drenched in squished tomatoes skins, seeds, juice and street salsa, clothes utterly destroyed.This event has garnered a lot of attention in the recent years and sees truckloads of tourists visiting the event. Today, the organizers actually cultivate inedible tomatoes especially for this event.  Also, to ensure that the festival is happy, hurt-free event for everyone, certain rules have been laid down by authorities - tomatoes have to be squashed before throwing, No other projectiles are allowed other than tomatoes , participants have to give way to the trucks and Lorries carrying tomatoes, etc.</p>

<p>Tomorrowland is one of the biggest European Music Festivals that takes place in Boom, Belgium that is only 32 Kilometers to the north of Brussels. The first edition of Tomorrowland was held in 2005 which was organized by ID&T, a Dutch entertainment company. There are several other similar music festivals but Tomorrowland distinctly stands out from the rest owing to the Fairytale stage designs that change into castles, cobras, bookcases. The lights and lasers animate the venue in the evenings. Another interesting and infamous aspect of Tomorrowland is the Church of Love, a temple dedicated to love that is guarded by naughty nuns. Couples can cuddle inside the reportedly cozy church for 15 minutes before rejoining the party outside.

However, since Tomorrowland is a music festival, it has much more than just visual delights. The top notch music systems literally make your heart beat harder than ever. Your feet start tapping involuntarily to the superlative beats dished out by some of the best performers, DJs and musicians. Most people attending Tomorrowland choose camping as their accommodation.
