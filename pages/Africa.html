<img src="../photos/africa images/look.jpg"  alt="BUSHFIRE" width="860" height="500"/>
<p>Each year 20 000 people head to Swaziland for the three-day Bushfire festival which offers a line up of music, theatre, poetry, dance and visual arts. The festival has a feel-good aspect:  all of its profits are donated to NGOs and community development projects. </p>
<p><b>Tips:</b> The National Arts Festival is one of the most important event on the Swaziland cultural calendar, and the biggest annual celebration of the arts on the African continent. Starting at the end of June/beginning of July, it runs for between 8 and 10 days and is held in the small university city of Grahamstown, which is situated in the Eastern Cape, 130km from Port Elizabeth.</p>

<h2>2. Festival-au-Desert</h2>
<h3>Mali, 5 January</h3>

<p>Billed as the "most remote music festival in the world" the Festival is a three-day Afro-pop powwow held by the Tuareg, the traditionally nomadic "blue people" of the Sahara. It's a tribe often feared for the banditry of its rebels and respected for the fact that it has never really been conquered. Combining traditional Tuareg music and dance, camel races, and competitions during the day, the Festival comes alive at night with modern Malian music, which is becoming popular the world over from incorporation into music as diverse as that of Robert Plant and Paul Simon.</p> 
<p><b>Tips:</b>The Dogons are famous for their masks and during the five-day event many of them are used in ritual ceremonies that go back more than 1000 years . At each Sigui festival, a new ceremonial mask is carved especially for the occasion, then placed in the Tellem caves. Remnants of these masks going back hundreds of years have been found in the caves.</p>
