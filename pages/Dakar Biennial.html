<h3>History</h3>
<img src="../photos/africa images/africa images/Dakar Beninial/1962934981_3d8ab6e415.jpg" width="860" height="500" alt="senegal" />
<p>The Dakar Biennale was conceived in 1989 as a biennale alternating between literature and art. The first edition in 1990 was focused on literature and in 1992 on visual art. In 1993 the structure of the biennale was transformed and Dak'Art 1996 became an exhibition specifically devoted to Contemporary African Art. In 1998 the structure was consolidated and in 2000 there was considerable change: Abdoulaye Wade was elected president of Senegal a few months before the opening of the event. The new president confirmed the support of the Senegalese government for the event and since 2000, Dak'Art has taken place bi-annually. Dak'Art 2002 was characterized by new staff and new partners. Dak'Art 2004 received more international visitors and wider press coverage; during the opening the president announced his intention to organise a new edition of the World Festival of Black Arts. For the first time an artistic director was appointed for Dak'Art 2006 and the event was organised with the participation of many artists and a more consistent budget. In 2008 the biennale decelerated. The event took place on a smaller budget and was organised at the last minute. In 2010 the European Commission - a major financial partner - did not support the event. In December the third edition of the World Festival of Black Arts was organised in Dakar. The 2014 edition was curated by Abdelkader Damani, Elise Atangana and Ugochukwu-Smooth Nzewi.[1] The 2016 edition was curated by Simon Njami.

Dak'Art is the African continent's longest running grand-scale art event. In 2014, it was opened to non-African nationals for the first time, with the exhibition 'Cultural Diversity' at the IFAN Theodore Monod Museum including invited internationals.[2]</p>
<p><b>On top of that....</b> The latest in African visual arts is now on display in Senegal's capital. Dakar is host to a month-long arts festival that's held every other year. NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton is taking it all in and has this report.

OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE: The Senegalese capital is buzzing with a 12th edition of the Dak'Art Contemporary African Art Biennial and playing host to artists and art-lovers from across the continent and all over the world. Simon Njami from Cameroon is the artistic director of the Dak'Art festival titled Re-enchantments. He says Africa must learn to become re-enchanted with itself through art.

SIMON NJAMI: (Speaking French).

QUIST-ARCTON: The curator says Africa must have confidence in itself to dream and make things happen. Njami has selected a younger group of Africans this year among the 70 exhibiting artists from 24 countries. The wheels of time must change, he says, to mix up the stew and make sure it's not the same old soup of established artists in the cooking pot.

He's chosen an unusual backdrop for the international art exhibition. Senegal's cavernous, abandoned Palais de Justice, the former law-courts-turned-biennial space with its broken windows and light seeping in, and in a courtyard houses a display of silk, African-inspired clothing hanging on a washing line. To the right is what looks like a gorgeous, giant light shade made of transparent plastic bags.

Step across the cracked flooring to an audiovisual installation of a topical subject, migration - a raft on the water from Senegal to Paris. Artists from Algeria via Nigeria to the Democratic Republic of Congo in the heart of Africa - all are on display. And it's impressive, say these Paris-based African visitors.

SAM LAMBERT: I am Sam Lambert from Angola. I think it's a great opportunity for young artists or young African artists. Actually, I didn't expect it to be this good. And it's quite inspiring, really.

AMAH AVIVI: My name is Amah Avivi. I'm from Togo, but I live in Paris. And I'm here in Dak'Art for the biennial with some friends. And I love the vibe and the spirit this biennial brings in Dak'Art and to show different African artists' works especially because in the world, people forgot about African inspiration, African creativity. And here, in this biennial, you can see that we have more and more African creativity coming out.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Since 1992, the Dak’Art has been a platform for contemporary art with cultural roots in Africa.
The Biennale of Contemporary African Art aims at being a space of different prejudice-free visions on approaches and inspirations to analyse in relation to a plurality of influences from both immediate and farther sources.

The environment itself is today characterised by its relative spatial limitations in spite of the strong influence of the immediate social environment. Dak’Art provides an occasion to fight the propensity to be prejudiced about contemporary art as expressed by some African creators by giving the floor to a different category of experts working at other levels of the visual arts world that refuse to confine themselves within some certainties and are concerned about a certain ethic.

In its maturation phase, Dak’Art is no doubt a relevant cultural proposal for the African Union. The history of the Biennale of Contemporary Art is the natural extension of a sum of reflections and actions carried out by intellectuals and culture experts from Africa and the diaspora who have very early been aware of the role culture plays faced with the varied challenges met at various stages in our societies’ progress towards a better life.

The Biennale of contemporary African art in Dakar is the only event of note on the continent to consecrate its selection in particular to living artists in and outside the continent.

It has enabled:

– to valorize the creation of new models in the field of arts
– to confirm or reveal new talents in the visual arts’ world as in the world of design and digital arts
– to create new approaches in the definition and the conceptual view of contemporary art in Africa
– to show to a large audience coming from all over the world a creative and innovative Africa
– to create new partnerships among African creators and also between African creators and creators from other continents

The biennale is created thanks to the will of both the Senegalese state which assumes the supervision and the local artists who since the seventies, have been organizing regular annual art exhibitions which bring to light the different shapes of the evolution of contemporary art creation. The aim was to make of it a show-window of Art and literature in Africa.

After two editions, the decision was made to focus the event exclusively on visual arts and on design with a small-scale exhibition in textiles and tapestry. Nowadays, digital arts take their place in Dak’Art. The tapestry and textiles show is no longer a part of the biennale.
